		<p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and 
		imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning 
		to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here 
		there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its
		people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so 
		that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch 
		me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your 
		failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, 
		when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die</p>
